aiosimplechat
=============

Very simple client-server chat application.

Trying out Python's new asyncio module to create a chat application.

### Requirements:
Python 3.3+

### Usage:
Start server.py

Start as many client.py instances as you like and start chatting to yourself!

### Goal:
See if it's possible to import these into an actual program to do real easy network communication.

Comments welcome :)
